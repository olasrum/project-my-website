      <p>When I was young, I wanted to be a rocket scientist. I don’t think I knew what a rocket scientist did and I’m still not sure, but I ended up being an accountant. Much of my accounting career involved investigating differences in reconciling sets of accounts. Understanding the source of the data and why systems were set up like they were became more interesting to me than the actual accounting side, so I made a move into the data governance space. I enjoyed learning even more about the interaction between data and systems and I did a couple of small courses in SQL, Python and networking.</p>
      <p>After taking some time out from the workplace, I decided that I would make a career change into the IT space. Lots of online searching led me to a software engineering course. It had many of the elements I was interested in like programming, data bases, career support and remote working opportunities. I also like the open-source ethos of the software world and there seems to be a real sense of community and wanting to share knowledge. Overall, I feel like software engineering will be a career that I will enjoy. Satisfying my analytical side, stimulating my creativity and providing an open and supportive community to help me on my journey. </p>
