      <h3>Starting-out</h3>
      <p>When I was young, I wanted to be a rocket scientist. I don’t think I knew what a rocket scientist did and I’m still not sure, but I ended up being an accountant. Much of my accounting career involved investigating differences in reconciling sets of accounts.</p>
      <h3>Broadening Horizons</h3>
      <p>Understanding the source of the data and why systems were set up like they were became more interesting to me than the actual accounting side, so I made a move into the data governance space as a data governance advisor. In this role, I enjoyed learning more about the interaction between data and systems and I did a couple of small courses in SQL, Python and networking.</p>
      <h3>Time-out</h3>
      <p>Taking some time out from the workplace was my next move after data governance. The time off was something I needed to do after experiencing some major life events that altered my world completely. When I was ready to think about returning to the workplace, I decided that I would make a career change into the IT space.</p>
      <h3>New Beginnings</h3>
      <p>Lots of online searching led me to a software engineering course. It could be balanced with my part-time role as a board company secretary and had many of the elements I was interested in like programming, data bases, career support and remote working opportunities. I also like the open-source ethos of the software world and there seems to be a real sense of community and wanting to share knowledge.</p>
      <h3>The Journey</h3>
      <p>Overall, I feel like software engineering will be a career that I will enjoy. Satisfying my analytical side, stimulating my creativity and providing an open and supportive community to help me on my journey.</p>
